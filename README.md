# Bulk Files Organizer
We have bunch of random files mainly in Desktop, Downloads , Documents or some other directories. If the number of files are large, it takes a lot of time to manage them manually.
Bulk-File-Organizer helps to organize bulk of these random files into proper Directories/Folders instantly and remove un-used empty Directories/Folders as well !

## How it works:-
We may have bulk of un-managed files which can become a headache to manage manually. Lets see the examples:

<img src="/Img/Linux_Img/unmanagedDirectory.png" width="49%" >  <img src="/Img/Windows_Img/unmanagedFolder.png"  width="49%">

The simple GUI helps us do the task simply.The GUI can differ according to OS. However, the functionality is same.

1. Choose the directory/Folder containing the bulk of files. 

<img src="/Img/Linux_Img/chooseDirectory.png" width='50%'> 

2. Click on the 'Organize' button after choosing the folder path.The 'Task Complete' message pops up if the folder path is correct. Otherwise it may prompt an error.

3. The files are now managed into proper Folders/Directories !

<img src="/Img/Linux_Img/managedDirectory.png" width="49%"> <img src="/Img/Windows_Img/managedFolder.png" width='49%' height='40%'>

## Use 'EXE' file directly (for windows users):-
If you wish to use 'EXE' file direclty and don't care about the code, follow the steps below:

1. Click on 'v1.0' under Releases at the right side of repo.

<img src='/Img/EXE_Download/release.png'>

2. Click on 'Source code(zip)' or 'Source code(tar.gz)' to download the zip or tar files.

<img src='/Img/EXE_Download/sourceCode.png'>

3. This file can be opened using WinRAR. 

<img src='/Img/EXE_Download/zipBulk.png'>

4. Then you can extract only the 'EXE_File' to the desired location.

<img src ='/Img/EXE_Download/extract.png'>

5. Now this organizer opens direcly from the '.exe' file ! 

<img src ='/Img/EXE_Download/exeFile.png'> 

Your may delete the WinRAR file now.

## Clone the repo:-
1. You can clone the repo ,however, if above steps doesn't suit you at any time. 
      
             git clone https://github.com/Saphall/Bulk-Files-Organizer.git
      
    If the error occurs, use following command to clone instead:
      
             git clone http://github.com/Saphall/Bulk-Files-Organizer.git

2. Then, you can run the organizer with command:

             python Bulk\ Files\ Organizer.py
   or 

             python3 Bulk\ Files\ Organizer.py

## Work On Progress !
The 'Advanced Setting' button doesn't perform any task for now. However, other functionality to manage bulk files are to be added. For example: a setting to manage bulk of Image
files (Image to PDF and vice-versa). Feel free to contribute !
